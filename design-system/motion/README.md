# Motion System

Motion in PROTANNI must feel **organic and unhurried**.

---

## Durations

- Micro interactions: `150–200ms`
- Page transitions: `200–300ms`
- Stagger: `50–80ms`

---

## Easing

- `ease-out` preferred
- No bounce
- No elastic
- No overshoot

---

## Framer Motion Rules

- Pages use container + item variants
- Always fade + slight translate
- Never animate color aggressively

Motion supports clarity, never attention-seeking.
